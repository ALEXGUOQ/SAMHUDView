# SAMHUDView

Kind of okay HUD. WIP. You should probably use [SVProgressHUD](https://github.com/TransitApp/SVProgressHUD) instead.

SAMHUDView is tested on iOS 6 and requires ARC. Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Installation

Simply add the files in the `SAMHUDView` folder and the `Resources` folder to your project or add `SAMHUDView` to your Podfile.
